    "question": "How to do sewage treatment",
    "answer": "Based EXCLUSIVELY on the provided documents, the following is an overview of sewage treatment:\n\nThe best way to protect streams from pollution is to prevent it at the source. Treatment of wastewater is essential to prevent pollution from point sources. Wastewater should be treated properly by primary and secondary methods to reduce BOD, COD levels up to permissible levels for discharge. Wastewater sewage contains several pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms and viruses that can cause water -borne diseases such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid, jaundice etc . High levels of pathogens may result from on -site sanitation systems (septic tanks, pit latrines) or inadequately treated sewage discharges . Combined sewers in certain cities discharge untreated sewage during rain storms that can result in contamination. The water is typically treated in industrial processes before it is returned to the water supply.\n        \nAnother potential type of waste water treatment is Decentralized Wastewater Treatment, which involves treating sewage close to its source, such as homes or communities. It reduces the load on large, central treatment plants and expands coverage in remote areas. These systems are cost-effective, energy-efficient, and quicker to implement. Treated water can be reused for gardening, flushing, or irrigation. Finally, wastewater can be used again for non-drinking purposes, referred to as Recycling and Reuse.\n\nParameters to consider for water quality are: BOD, chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrates, phosphates, oil and grease, toxic metals\n",
